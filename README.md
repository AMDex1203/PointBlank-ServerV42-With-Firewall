# Point Blank Server Private - UDP3

Client version `1.15.42`

## Summary
This server is a version adapted and modified completely by me. The public source was used as a basis, which as many know is full of flaws, bugs and vulnerabilities.
I developed this version initially for **Project Bloodi**, as well as the website that is also published on my github.
This modified version contains hundreds of changes, new systems against Bot attacks, etc... The database has been changed almost entirely. 

## Thanks
- **Project Kyozima** I couldn't stop thanking you, especially **Kevin Teves**.
- **Wesley**
- If it weren't for the attacks and attempts to take down this server, some with success and others not, I wouldn't have done so many corrections on it and got where I am. I consider these two my biggest enemies in the community. Regardless, they helped me a lot.
- **Projectct Bloodi** - Since the beginning this server has always been dedicated to this project.
- **Project Elite**, which helped me the most with exchanges of knowledge about the server.
